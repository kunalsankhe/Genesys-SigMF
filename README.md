# Signal Metadata Format (SigMF)

Welcome to the GENESYS SigMF project! The SigMF specification document is the
`sigmf-spec.md` file in this repository:

SigMF: [Signal Metadata Format Specification](sigmf-spec.md)

## Introduction

Sharing sets of recorded signal data is an important part of science and
engineering. It enables multiple parties to collaborate, is often a necessary
part of reproducing scientific results (a requirement of scientific rigor), and
enables sharing data with those who do not have direct access to the equipment
required to capture it.

Unfortunately, these datasets have historically not been very portable, and
there is not an agreed upon method of sharing metadata descriptions of the
recorded data itself. This is the problem that SigMF solves.

By providing a standard way to describe data recordings, SigMF facilitates the
sharing of data, prevents the "bitrot" of datasets wherein details of the
capture are lost over time, and makes it possible for different tools to operate
on the same dataset, thus enabling data portability between tools and workflows.
